# Chubak Bidpaa: Leave the Coding to Me!

## Introcution

Hi! My name is Chubak Bidpaa. I have recently re-discovered my life for gaming. I was born in March 12, 1993 (Esfand 21, 1371). I attended over 6 schools during my time in school because we moved around a lot. I have studied English Literature, French Literautre, and Compute Science in college. I also studied screenwriting but for only one session, my classmates ran me out of the class after I recommend our professor to have everyone watch "The Dog Massacre", a great movie I had watched as a kid. Well, their loss!

I got enough CS education at college but college was not my introduction to programming. In fact, I started learning how to program at the young age of 16. The first language I programmed with was GML. I made a Tetris game with it. After that I learned PHP, Perl, Python, and the C#. My current stack is:

* Rust: My go-to gal
* Go: My side gal
* Python: My wife that I hate
* JS: My sister
* Kotlin: My cousin that I don't talk to often
* Nim: The young ditzy girl in my life that I so wanna go with but she's just not ready.

I enjoy doing systems programming, especially systems automation, web automation, machine learning, deep learning and general programming. If you give me a project and tell me "DO IT!" I will find a way to do it. 

I am a somehow-freelancer somehow-employee somehow-contractor with my friend Felix Quinque. I also work with Mr. Herman Jacons at Cherry. I sometimes collab on projects with my friend Tanami Muller.

Over the years I have racked up a cute sum of projects. Let me run you through some of them.

## Projects

### Machine Learning

* [PuertoRECO](https://github.com/Chubek/PuertoRECO) -> Despite the lame pun, this is a very intricate face recognition API. It's in Python so it's not very fast. In the recent months I have decided to do less and less projects in Python because of how slow and inefficient it is. But if you are going to give me a job in Python I will do it. I especially like training using Python and predictiing and doing the MLOps in Rust or Go.
* [WillSh3B33](https://github.com/Chubek/will-sh3-b33) -> Basically a backend and a frontend for a model I made. This shows my skills in MLOps. The model itself, it's not very strong but I have learend a lot about training and structuring models since then.
* [Arriv-O-Pred](https://github.com/Chubek/Arriv-O-Pred) -> Basic train time arrival tool which Felix helped me make in my early days. After Tanami, I owe most my professional life to Felix. This man's a behemoth of ML!
* [SongOfSprockets](https://github.com/Chubek/SongOfTheSprockets) -> A voice conversion tool using GMM, a fork of Sprocker-VC with a UI using Dear Imgui.
* [ClickBait Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/clickbait-generator) -> A very simple clickbait generator project.
* [pyramid-anomyaly-detection](https://github.com/Chubek/pyramid-anomally-detection) -> Anomaly detection in Python that makes heavy use of vectorization.

### Automation (System & Web)
* [Upsc3ne](https://github.com/Chubek/upsc3ne) -> An obscenity detector written in Rust. It's kinda incomplete but already contains implementation for Levenshtein distance and fuzzy string matching.
* [mathcord](https://github.com/Chubek/mathcord) -> My pride and joy. A Discord math bot that includes CUSTOM implementation of Edwards-25519, SHA-512, Shunting Yard and communication with Discord API.
* [potpourri](https://github.com/Chubek/potpourri) -> A webscraper library for Python. Can search Google too. Can do a lot of stuff.
* [CroonJoobGoo](https://github.com/Chubek/CroonJoobGoo) -> A cron job automator written entirely in Go. Right now it only does SQL queries/commands.

### Graphics Programming and Gaming

* [Bedlam Noise Apparatus](https://github.com/Chubek/Bedlam-Noise-Apparatus) -> Oh BOY I love this one! A pretty solid After Effects plugin that generates noise using OpenGL and GLSL. I think it's one of the few FOSS After Effects plugisn out there. 
* [Rusty Random Pattern Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-random-pattern-generator) -> A simple pattern generator in Rust.
* [Pong Q-Learning](https://github.com/Chubek/pong-q-learning-nim) -> This is a composite of ML and Game Dev. It uses Reinforcement learning to play Pong. Written in Nim using SDL.


### Misc.

* [Mongoose Jumblator](https://github.com/Chubek/mongoose-jumblator) -> A Typescript NPM package that encrypts MongoDB database content.
